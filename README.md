This small library provides various mechanisms for reading a file one line at a time. These utilities aren't necessarily meant to be used as a library for use in production code  (though you're more than welcome to) but rather to profile and benchmark various iteration constructs. See [Benchmarking Readline Iterators](https://bbengfort.github.io/programmer/2016/12/22/benchmarking-readlines.html) for a complete post about this repository.
